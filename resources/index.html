          <h2>How Do You Play?</h2>
          <p class="res-answer">The basic objective of Go is to surround as many intersections on the board with your stones as possible. While this sounds simple, there are several additional rules that add great depth to the game. <a href="http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/">This</a> is a great introduction on the rules of the game.</p>

          <h2>Playing Online</h2>
          <p class="res-answer">It's never been easier to play Go online! There are many Go servers out there these days, but as a beginner you can't go wrong with <a href="https://online-go.com">OGS</a>. There are other options, however, these will require you to download a client in order to play against others. Both <a href="https://www.gokgs.com">KGS</a> and <a href="http://www.tygemgo.com">Tygem</a> are two popular choices, as is <a href="http://pandanet-igs.com/communities/pandanet">Pandanet/IGS</a>.</p>

          <h2>The Ranking System</h2>
          <p class="res-answer">In order to measure the strength of Go players, a ranking system was created. The system divides players into ranks of Kyus and Dans. Kyus are typically students who are learning the game and as such correspond to a negative value. The lowest rank in Go is 30 Kyu which corresponds to a rank of -30. Dans are players who have acheived somewhat of a mastery of the game and correspond to positive values. The highest rank in Go is 9 Dan which corresponds to a rank of +9.
